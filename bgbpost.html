    <h1>Low and Slow</h1>
    <p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called sous vide.
       In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic)
       into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to.
       In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</p>
    <p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</b>
       To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>

        <p>Warning: Sous vide cooked salmon is not pasteurized.
           Avoid it if you are pregnant or have immunity issues.</p>
